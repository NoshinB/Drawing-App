For our app we decided to create the following tools:
    1) Thearapeutic tool (icon: colour pencils and stencil)
        - For this tool users can change the colour of the flower design.
    2) 3D Tool (icon: 3D)
        - Users can click on cavas and move cursor around to get different 3d shapes design on the canvas. 
    3) Heart tool (icon: Heard with pencil)
        - Users can stamp hearts on the canvas and change the colour of the hearts. We also added an ombre effect to the hearts. 
    4) Rabbit tool (icon: rabbit)
        - Users can stamp  cute rabbits all over the canvas. 
    5) Particles tool (icon: dots)
        Users can click on the canvas and place small 'explosions' of particles and users can change colour of the particles.
    6) Kaliedoscope tool (icon: Kaliedoscope)
        - This is a symettry tool in the shape of a kaliedoscope.
    7) Emoji tool (icon: emoji)
        - Users can stamp emoji when mouse is pressed on the canvas.
    8) Water droplet (icon: tear drop)
        - Users can watch a video of different water dyes at the bottom of the canvas (please scroll down). 
        
Things we need to improve on:
    - We will be working on having the user specifically choose what water dye colour video they want to watch, and move it to the main canvas.
    - We will be working on adding more tools. 
    - We will also work on adding help messages for each tool.
